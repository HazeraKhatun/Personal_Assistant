This project introduces an outstanding experience of an artificial companionship which can plan, edit, remind and find oneâ€™s schedules as per their command which can be manual, or voice controlled. Humans are forgetful in nature. They need some assistance from others to keep track of their plans and schedules and manage them efficiently to avoid unexpected consequences resulting from forgetfulness for any personal or unexpected reason. But not everyone can afford a personal assistant. This project allows people to enjoy the assistance of an electronic device which can manage their schedules with a simple voice command as if they were talking to their personal assistant and it can remind them their plans the time they want and the way they want without any mistake.
